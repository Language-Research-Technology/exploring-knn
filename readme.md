The purpose of this notebook is to provide options for exploring large image datasets, through use of K nearest neighbour graphs and other methods. It aims to be a base for further development in future.

This notebook ingests a zip file containing images, and returns a HTML file (giving options for visual exploration of the dataset), and provides some basic visualisations.
