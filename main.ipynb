    "    - Is one more even than the other? etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The general theme of clusters (from setting `group_clusters` to not `False`)\n",
    "    - Some clusters have very explicit themes \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The 'arms' and 'clusters' in the force directed diagram\n",
    "    - Using the selection tool in the notebook to see if there are themes to arms and clusters\n",
    "    - Compare how these themes differ to the cluster themes \n",
